According to Sucuri, any plugin or theme that uses Genericons is vulnerable due to an insecure file included within the package. Genericons ships with a file called example.html which is vulnerable to attack from the Document Object Model level or DOM for short. The Open Web Application Security Project defines a DOM based attack as: DOM Based  XSS (or as it is called in some texts, ‘type-0 XSS’) is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM ‘environment’ in the victim’s browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an ‘unexpected’ manner. That is, the page itself (the HTTP response that is) does not change, but the client side code contained in the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment. The payload for these types of attacks is executed directly in the browser. Even Sucuri’s website firewall is unable to block the attack since it never gets the chance to see it. The company however, has virtually patched the vulnerability. Sucuri worked with a number of hosting providers to identify and remove the example.html file from their servers. If you use the following webhosts, you should already be patched as of a week ago.  GoDaddy HostPapa DreamHost ClickHost InMotion WPEngine Pagely Pressable Websynthesis Site5 SiteGround  According to Sucuri, the example.html file was used for debugging and testing purposes but was mistakenly left inside the directory after the project was packaged for production environments. This simple oversight has placed millions of sites at risk as Twenty Fifteen is a default theme that ships with WordPress. You should update the Twenty Fifteen theme and Jetpack regardless of which webhost you’re using. You should also remain vigilant and keep an eye out for additional plugin and theme updates. If possible, manually remove example.html from within the Genericons directory. Update WordPress 4.2.2 is available as a security update that addresses the Genericons issue and contains bug fixes.''>WPTavern: XSS Vulnerability in Jetpack and the Twenty Fifteen Default Theme Affects Millions of WordPress Users</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/andrew-nacin-on-challenging-wordpress-assumptions'' title=''WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin spoke at the php[world] 2014 conference on “Challenging Your WordPress Assumptions from 2009.” The video was recently published on YouTube and provides an excellent overview of the major ways WordPress has changed over the past six years. Nacin explores common assumptions, such as “WordPress is insecure,” “WordPress doesn’t scale,” and “WordPress is not OOP,” among others. Some of these assumptions are false, some are true, some used to be true and others are partially true. If you’re a PHP developer who is new to WordPress or curious about how it’s changed over the years, this presentation will give you a quick 30 minute overview. Check out the video embedded below to learn more about WordPress’ philosophy for building user-centered software, its commitment to maintaining backwards compatibility, and how major publishers and companies are using it in innovative ways.

The Indian retail market is estimated to be US$ 450 billion and one of the top five retail markets in the world by economic value. India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\r\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers. India''s retail and logistics industry employs about 40 million Indians (3.3% of Indian population)</p>\r\n        <p>Total retail employment in India, both organized and unorganized, account for about 6% of Indian labour work force currently - most of which is unorganized. This is about a third of levels in United States and Europe; and about half of levels in other emerging economies. A complete expansion of retail sector to levels and productivity similar to other emerging economies and developed economies such as the United States would create over 50 million jobs in India. </p>\r\n        <p>Hence, Training and Development of labour and management for higher retail productivity is expected to be a challenge.</p>\r\n        <p>KVM Academy is eminently positioned to carryout skill development program specific to Retail Industry with focus on Customer Relationship Management at all levels.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country. While there will be huge opportunities in sales and distribution, there will be good number of opportunities in policy servicing, claim processing, actuarial services, underwriting, investments etc. There will be demand for trained people in these specialized areas when the industry is poised for the next high growth phase.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Insurance Course Content:</h3>\r\n        <p>Origin of Insurance and its Elementary Aspects: Concepts, Modern forms, Regulation, Milestones and Basics Principles of Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Principles of Life Insurance: Introduction—Characteristics of Life Insurance Contract, Essentials of Valid Contracts—Difference between Life Insurance and Other Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Products: Introduction—Financial Needs, Term Life, Endowment Assurance Policies, Whole Life, UnitLinked, and Annuity Policies, Group Insurance, Riders etc.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Conditions: Introduction—Policy Provisions, Structure, Conditions and Privileges-Typical Policy Bond Structure, Supplementary Benefits and Unit Linked Policy''s special Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Underwriting: Risk Classifications, Purposes and Methods, Factors affecting Mortality, Assessment of Risk, Incidence and Method of Extra Risk taking, Underwriting Process.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <p>Pricing: Basic Elements in Computation and Mortality, Premium Calculation, Level and Net Premium Calculation, Office Premium, Policy Valuation and its Methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Servicing: Importance and Nature of Policy Servicing, Organization Structure and Departmentalization of Insurance Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Benefits Payment: Guidlines, Classification etc.,--Surrender Benefits, Maturity, Death and Repudiation of Claims, Evidence of Titile, Nomination, Assignment, Intestate Claims, Payments of Annuities and Claims on Small Life Insurance Policies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- JS Menu -->\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[\r\n$(document).ready(function(){ 	$(''.toggle_services'').click(function(){ 		var id=$(this).attr(''id''); 		$(''.display_none'').removeClass(''display_block''); 		$(''#a_''+id).addClass(''display_block''); 		$(''.toggle_services'').removeClass(''active''); 		$(this).addClass(''active''); 	}); });\r\n// ]]></script>', 'Course Details', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'course-details', '', '', '2014-02-13 07:42:34', '2014-02-13 07:42:34', '', 0, 'http://kvmacademy.com/?page_id=143', 0, 'page', '', 0),

India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\n\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\n\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy.

India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\r\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers.

This is about a third of levels in United States and Europe; and about half of levels in other emerging economies. A complete expansion of retail sector to levels and productivity similar to other emerging economies and developed economies such as the United States would create over 50 million jobs in India. </p>\r\n        <p>Hence, Training and Development of labour and management for higher retail productivity is expected to be a challenge.</p>\r\n        <p>KVM Academy is eminently positioned to carryout skill development program specific to Retail Industry with focus on Customer Relationship Management at all levels.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country. While there will be huge opportunities in sales and distribution, there will be good number of opportunities in policy servicing, claim processing, actuarial services, underwriting, investments etc. There will be demand for trained people in these specialized areas when the industry is poised for the next high growth phase.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Insurance Course Content:</h3>\r\n        <p>Origin of Insurance and its Elementary Aspects: Concepts, Modern forms, Regulation, Milestones and Basics Principles of Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Principles of Life Insurance: Introduction—Characteristics of Life Insurance Contract, Essentials of Valid Contracts—Difference between Life Insurance and Other Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Products: Introduction—Financial Needs, Term Life, Endowment Assurance Policies, Whole Life, UnitLinked, and Annuity Policies, Group Insurance, Riders etc.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Conditions: Introduction—Policy Provisions, Structure, Conditions and Privileges-Typical Policy Bond Structure, Supplementary Benefits and Unit Linked Policy''s special Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Underwriting: Risk Classifications, Purposes and Methods, Factors affecting Mortality, Assessment of Risk, Incidence and Method of Extra Risk taking, Underwriting Process.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <p>Pricing: Basic Elements in Computation and Mortality, Premium Calculation, Level and Net Premium Calculation, Office Premium, Policy Valuation and its Methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Servicing: Importance and Nature of Policy Servicing, Organization Structure and Departmentalization of Insurance Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Benefits Payment: Guidlines, Classification etc.,--Surrender Benefits, Maturity, Death and Repudiation of Claims, Evidence of Titile, Nomination, Assignment, Intestate Claims, Payments of Annuities and Claims on Small Life Insurance Policies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- JS Menu -->\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[\r\n$(document).ready(function(){ 	$(''.toggle_services'').click(function(){ 		var id=$(this).attr(''id''); 		$(''.display_none'').removeClass(''display_block''); 		$(''#a_''+id).addClass(''display_block''); 		$(''.toggle_services'').removeClass(''active''); 		$(this).addClass(''active''); 	}); });\r\n// ]]></script>', 'Course Details', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '143-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-11 10:35:22', '2014-02-11 10:35:22', '', 143, 'http://kvmacademy.com/143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country. While there will be huge opportunities in sales and distribution, there will be good number of opportunities in policy servicing, claim processing, actuarial services, underwriting, investments etc. There will be demand for trained people in these specialized areas when the industry is poised for the next high growth phase.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Insurance Course Content:</h3>\r\n        <p>Origin of Insurance and its Elementary Aspects: Concepts, Modern forms, Regulation, Milestones and Basics Principles of Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Principles of Life Insurance: Introduction—Characteristics of Life Insurance Contract, Essentials of Valid Contracts—Difference between Life Insurance and Other Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Products: Introduction—Financial Needs, Term Life, Endowment Assurance Policies, Whole Life, UnitLinked, and Annuity Policies, Group Insurance, Riders etc.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Conditions: Introduction—Policy Provisions, Structure, Conditions and Privileges-Typical Policy Bond Structure, Supplementary Benefits and Unit Linked Policy''s special Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Underwriting: Risk Classifications, Purposes and Methods, Factors affecting Mortality, Assessment of Risk, Incidence and Method of Extra Risk taking, Underwriting Process.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <p>Pricing: Basic Elements in Computation and Mortality, Premium Calculation, Level and Net Premium Calculation, Office Premium, Policy Valuation and its Methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Servicing: Importance and Nature of Policy Servicing, Organization Structure and Departmentalization of Insurance Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Benefits Payment: Guidlines, Classification etc.,--Surrender Benefits, Maturity, Death and Repudiation of Claims, Evidence of Titile, Nomination, Assignment, Intestate Claims, Payments of Annuities and Claims on Small Life Insurance Policies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- JS Menu -->\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[\r\n$(document).ready(function(){ 	$(''.toggle_services'').click(function(){ 		var id=$(this).attr(''id''); 		$(''.display_none'').removeClass(''display_block''); 		$(''#a_''+id).addClass(''display_block''); 		$(''.toggle_services'').removeClass(''active''); 		$(this).addClass(''active''); 	}); });\r\n// ]]></script>', 'Course Details', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '143-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-11 11:24:38', '2014-02-11 11:24:38', '', 143, 'http://kvmacademy.com/143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates! The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) puts the need for skilled hands in India at 530 million. With globalisation being a reality and foreign investments in India on the rise, the gap between the academia and corporates is increasing steadily.\n\n<strong>Mr. K.V. Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\n\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\n\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\n\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\nFranklinCovey Co.

The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N.

A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates!

KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\r\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\r\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates! The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) puts the need for skilled hands in India at 530 million. With globalisation being a reality and foreign investments in India on the rise, the gap between the academia and corporates is increasing steadily.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. K.V. Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\r\n\r\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\r\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\r\nFranklinCovey Co.

an Academic Council constituting India’s most respected names</li>\n	<li>Providing readily employable executives to the industry</li>\n	<li>JV to be formed between KVM Academy &amp; FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Chennai, 19th December 2012:</h4>\nFranklinCovey ( India &amp; SouthAsia operations ) a leading global training and consulting institute, today announced an exclusive partnership with KVM Group, a leading project advisory and service provider in IT, Architecture and Trading, for the launch of FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma in association with KVM Academy – a national education initiative to address the growing challenge of skill development and employability across sectors. KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates! The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) puts the need for skilled hands in India at 530 million. With globalisation being a reality and foreign investments in India on the rise, the gap between the academia and corporates is increasing steadily.\n\n<strong>Mr. K.V. Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\n\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\n\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\n\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\nFranklinCovey Co.

KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\r\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\r\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates! The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) puts the need for skilled hands in India at 530 million. With globalisation being a reality and foreign investments in India on the rise, the gap between the academia and corporates is increasing steadily.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. K.V. Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\r\n\r\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\r\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\r\nFranklinCovey Co.

Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\r\n\r\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\r\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\r\nFranklinCovey Co.

KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\r\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\r\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates!

The Indian retail market is estimated to be US$ 450 billion and one of the top five retail markets in the world by economic value. India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\r\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers. India''s retail and logistics industry employs about 40 million Indians (3.3% of Indian population)</p>\r\n        <p>Total retail employment in India, both organized and unorganized, account for about 6% of Indian labour work force currently - most of which is unorganized. This is about a third of levels in United States and Europe; and about half of levels in other emerging economies. A complete expansion of retail sector to levels and productivity similar to other emerging economies and developed economies such as the United States would create over 50 million jobs in India. </p>\r\n        <p>Hence, Training and Development of labour and management for higher retail productivity is expected to be a challenge.</p>\r\n        <p>KVM Academy is eminently positioned to carryout skill development program specific to Retail Industry with focus on Customer Relationship Management at all levels.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country. While there will be huge opportunities in sales and distribution, there will be good number of opportunities in policy servicing, claim processing, actuarial services, underwriting, investments etc. There will be demand for trained people in these specialized areas when the industry is poised for the next high growth phase.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Insurance Course Content:</h3>\r\n        <p>Origin of Insurance and its Elementary Aspects: Concepts, Modern forms, Regulation, Milestones and Basics Principles of Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Principles of Life Insurance: Introduction—Characteristics of Life Insurance Contract, Essentials of Valid Contracts—Difference between Life Insurance and Other Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Products: Introduction—Financial Needs, Term Life, Endowment Assurance Policies, Whole Life, UnitLinked, and Annuity Policies, Group Insurance, Riders etc.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Conditions: Introduction—Policy Provisions, Structure, Conditions and Privileges-Typical Policy Bond Structure, Supplementary Benefits and Unit Linked Policy''s special Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Underwriting: Risk Classifications, Purposes and Methods, Factors affecting Mortality, Assessment of Risk, Incidence and Method of Extra Risk taking, Underwriting Process.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <p>Pricing: Basic Elements in Computation and Mortality, Premium Calculation, Level and Net Premium Calculation, Office Premium, Policy Valuation and its Methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Servicing: Importance and Nature of Policy Servicing, Organization Structure and Departmentalization of Insurance Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Benefits Payment: Guidlines, Classification etc.,--Surrender Benefits, Maturity, Death and Repudiation of Claims, Evidence of Titile, Nomination, Assignment, Intestate Claims, Payments of Annuities and Claims on Small Life Insurance Policies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- JS Menu -->\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[\r\n$(document).ready(function(){ 	$(''.toggle_services'').click(function(){ 		var id=$(this).attr(''id''); 		$(''.display_none'').removeClass(''display_block''); 		$(''#a_''+id).addClass(''display_block''); 		$(''.toggle_services'').removeClass(''active''); 		$(this).addClass(''active''); 	}); });\r\n// ]]></script>', 'Course Details', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '143-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-13 07:36:28', '2014-02-13 07:36:28', '', 143, 'http://kvmacademy.com/143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\r\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country.

The Indian retail market is estimated to be US$ 450 billion and one of the top five retail markets in the world by economic value. India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world, with 1.2 billion people.</p>\r\n        <p>As of 2013, India''s retailing industry was essentially owner manned small shops. In 2010, larger format convenience stores and supermarkets accounted for about 4 percent of the industry, and these were present only in large urban centers. India''s retail and logistics industry employs about 40 million Indians (3.3% of Indian population)</p>\r\n        <p>Total retail employment in India, both organized and unorganized, account for about 6% of Indian labour work force currently - most of which is unorganized. This is about a third of levels in United States and Europe; and about half of levels in other emerging economies. A complete expansion of retail sector to levels and productivity similar to other emerging economies and developed economies such as the United States would create over 50 million jobs in India. </p>\r\n        <p>Hence, Training and Development of labour and management for higher retail productivity is expected to be a challenge.</p>\r\n        <p>KVM Academy is eminently positioned to carryout skill development program specific to Retail Industry with focus on Customer Relationship Management at all levels.

As per the current regulations FDI in insurance sector is limited to 26% . So most foreign players tied up with Indian companies and started business. There is a strong demand to increase the FDI to 46%, but it is pending decision of the parliament for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The leading companies in life insurance other than the state owned LIC are SBI Life Insurance Company limited, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company limited, HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company limited and Max Life. There are 24 Life insurance companies operating in India now. The life insurance segment contributes about 4.4 per cent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten annually. This is too low compared to the global average. Since the life insurance sector was opened up in 2000, it has now gone through two clear cycles - the first of very high growth (CAGR of over 12 per cent in number of new policies between 2000-10) and then one of substantive moderation (CAGR of over 9 per cent between 2010-13). Despite this, long-term growth prospects for the industry remain intact. \r\n        With huge educated young population entering the working class in the coming years, the future of life insurance in India is very bright in the coming days.  It is estimated that the sector will grow at a compounded average growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 15-20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The public sector companies in non life insurance sector are New India , National, Oriental and United India. ICICI Lombard ,Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Ergo, Iffco – Tokio and Reliance General are the leading players in the private sector. Totally there are 28 non life insurance companies operating in India.  The non life premium was growing at 11% for the period 2000- 2013. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the sector over the last decade, insurance in India remains at an early stage of development. The Indian insurance market (in terms of premium volume) was the 19th largest in the world. This was despite India being the second most populous country in the world as well as a leading economy. This shows the scope for the growth in the non life insurance sector in India.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Our country of a billion plus population is going to be the next growth engine for the world economy and insurance industry can play a huge role in the long term financing of the country’s economy. This offers tremendous opportunities both directly and indirectly to the educated youth of the country. While there will be huge opportunities in sales and distribution, there will be good number of opportunities in policy servicing, claim processing, actuarial services, underwriting, investments etc. There will be demand for trained people in these specialized areas when the industry is poised for the next high growth phase.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Insurance Course Content:</h3>\r\n        <p>Origin of Insurance and its Elementary Aspects: Concepts, Modern forms, Regulation, Milestones and Basics Principles of Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Principles of Life Insurance: Introduction—Characteristics of Life Insurance Contract, Essentials of Valid Contracts—Difference between Life Insurance and Other Insurance.</p>\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Products: Introduction—Financial Needs, Term Life, Endowment Assurance Policies, Whole Life, UnitLinked, and Annuity Policies, Group Insurance, Riders etc.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Conditions: Introduction—Policy Provisions, Structure, Conditions and Privileges-Typical Policy Bond Structure, Supplementary Benefits and Unit Linked Policy''s special Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Life Insurance Underwriting: Risk Classifications, Purposes and Methods, Factors affecting Mortality, Assessment of Risk, Incidence and Method of Extra Risk taking, Underwriting Process.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <p>Pricing: Basic Elements in Computation and Mortality, Premium Calculation, Level and Net Premium Calculation, Office Premium, Policy Valuation and its Methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Servicing: Importance and Nature of Policy Servicing, Organization Structure and Departmentalization of Insurance Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Policy Benefits Payment: Guidlines, Classification etc.,--Surrender Benefits, Maturity, Death and Repudiation of Claims, Evidence of Titile, Nomination, Assignment, Intestate Claims, Payments of Annuities and Claims on Small Life Insurance Policies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- JS Menu -->\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[\r\n$(document).ready(function(){ 	$(''.toggle_services'').click(function(){ 		var id=$(this).attr(''id''); 		$(''.display_none'').removeClass(''display_block''); 		$(''#a_''+id).addClass(''display_block''); 		$(''.toggle_services'').removeClass(''active''); 		$(this).addClass(''active''); 	}); });\r\n// ]]></script>', 'Course Details', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '143-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-13 07:42:34', '2014-02-13 07:42:34', '', 143, 'http://kvmacademy.com/143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

operations ) a leading global training and consulting institute, today announced an exclusive partnership with KVM Group, a leading project advisory and service provider in IT, Architecture and Trading, for the launch of FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma in association with KVM Academy – a national education initiative to address the growing challenge of skill development and employability across sectors. KVM Academy will be operational from July 2013.\r\nKVM Academy is the first ever initiative of its kind in India. The One-year “FranklinCovey Post Graduate (PG) Diploma” programs will be conducted across leading colleges in the country. The programs will not just constitute theoretical learning but also provide extensive soft &amp; behavoural skills training, focusing on communication , team working , leadership ,effectiveness , business acumen skills and more to empower the students to excel in their respective domains. The course will impart comprehensive knowledge fully supported by skills &amp; tool sets so that the knowledge can be effectively used and implemented in real life and at work to achieve desired results . The academy will be guided by an Advisory Board &amp; Academic Council with luminaries including Padma Bhushan Mr. N. Vittal (former Chief Vigilance Commissioner, Govt. of India), Mr. Mohan Lall (former Commissioner of IT), Mr Ravindra Gupta (former Chairman, BIFR), Mr. Bijon Nag (Chairman, IFB Industries) ,Mr. Rajan Kaicker (Executive Chairman and MD, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia) &amp; Mr. Lavleen Raheja ( Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia )\r\nRationale for setting up the KVM Academy is validated by several industry reports. A McKinsey report finds that only 25% of the engineers, 15% of finance graduates and less than 10% of other graduates are employable out of the graduates who pass out of the colleges. It has also been reported that only 3.5% of India’s population graduates. If 90% of the graduates are unemployable, it means that barely 0.5% of India’s population comprises employable graduates! The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) puts the need for skilled hands in India at 530 million. With globalisation being a reality and foreign investments in India on the rise, the gap between the academia and corporates is increasing steadily.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. K.V. Madhan, Managing Director, KVM Group of Companies</strong>, said, “<strong><em>KVM Academy is an endeavour to prepare graduates for a world of opportunities by imparting industry-specific knowledge and skills. Both the CII and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that inability of educational institutions in India to impart vocational training will lead to a ‘talent gap’ of more than 5 million by 2012. Addressing the two urgent needs of India Inc., this initiative with FranklinCovey will precisely address the employability gap and help craft a holistic learning program for students.</em></strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr. Lavleen Raheja, Chairman &amp; CEO, FranklinCovey India &amp; SouthAsia</strong> said, “<strong>This challenging program will help the industry as much as it helps the students. The corporates get readily employable graduates which saves them money and time. And the students get an opportunity to specialize and get employed in a vocation of their choice – a clear example of Dr. Stephen Covey’s 4th habit of thinking Win-Win.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the first year, the PG Diploma program will be rolled out in 4 cities across India. The course will focus on verticals such as Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Retail, Realty, SME Manufacturing, Hospitality &amp; Tourism and Healthcare &amp; Wellness. The program is designed for graduates who wish to pursue a career in their chosen areas of interest. While embarking on a career path, there could often be some confusion on which path to take. To clear this, the admission process will include an aptitude test and an interview to help the students decide what is best for them. This focus on the choice of students and the strong panel of subject matter experts is what gives KVM Academy the edge over others.\r\n\r\nKVM Academy is in the process of forging tie-ups with corporates and financial institutions for their executive requirements. This domain specialisation will remove the need for training new entrants in an organisation saving money and valuable time.\r\n<h4>About Franklin Covey :</h4>\r\nFranklinCovey Co.
